This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) for a Tesla-inspired infotainment system, developed using the Qt framework. The interface is designed to resemble the sleek, modern infotainment systems found in Tesla vehicles, with a focus on user experience, intuitive controls, and visually appealing design.
The system allows users to interact with various elements of an infotainment system, including navigation, media controls, climate settings, and vehicle information. This project serves as a prototype and can be adapted or extended for real-world automotive applications
